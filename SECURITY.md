# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As the plugins are currently in a very early stage, only their latest version will
receive security patches, so please make sure to update the plugins frequently.
Please note that breaking changes on the plugins themselves are currently not expected,
but they might be required in case of breaking changes in Genkit or in the respective
official SDKs. In either case, a migration guide will be provided to ease the transition
to the latest version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability, please [open a bug report](https://github.com/Dabolus/genkit-plugins/issues/new?assignees=Dabolus&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md)
so that we can keep track of it and fix it. Pull requests are also welcome.
